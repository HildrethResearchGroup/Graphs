# Motivation and History

1. Organize and visualize data
	2. Show how 1-2 data files expands to 4-5 files
	3. Show files in Graphs
2. Paper - Mekentos, MP3's - iTunes
3. Parses and Graphs data on demand
4. Create parser in Graphs
5. Uses DataGraph framework so that graphs made in DataGraph can be used as templates
6. By leveraging the DataGraph framework, we can decouple making the graph from organizing and visuallizing your data.  This simplifies Graphs' interface and allows you to make complex graphs in DataGraph and easily use them in Graphs
